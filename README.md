# Bookstore SQL Analysis

This project is a basic SQL analysis done to understand sales and customer patterns in a bookstore dataset.  
The main objective was to practice writing SQL queries on a real-world styled dataset and extract useful insights.

## Dataset
The project uses three CSV files:
- Customers.csv – contains customer information
- Orders.csv – contains order and purchase details
- Books.csv – contains book details such as price and category

The data is used only for learning and analysis purposes.

## What I worked on
- Created tables and defined relationships between them
- Joined multiple tables to answer business questions
- Used aggregate functions like SUM, COUNT, and AVG
- Applied GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
- Wrote subqueries for more detailed analysis
- Used CASE statements where required

## Insights from the analysis
- Identified top customers based on total spending
- Found books and categories generating the highest revenue
- Analyzed order patterns across customers
- Compared average order values

## How to use this project
1. Create tables using the SQL file inside the schema folder
2. Import the CSV files into the database
3. Run the queries from the sql folder to view results

## Tools used
- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- GitHub
